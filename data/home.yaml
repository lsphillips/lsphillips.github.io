introduction: |
  Hey there, I'm not your average software engineer - I actually think JavaScript is a fantastic language! When I'm not tinkering with code, you'll catch me trying too hard playing board games, pampering my pets as if they were royalty, and exploring dungeons in the Legend of Zelda.
